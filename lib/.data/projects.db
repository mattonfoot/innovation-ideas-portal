{"title":"Could a new service request protocol like GraphQL enable more reuse of microservices and enable faster prototyping and development lifecycles?","status":"in draft","link":"https://jira.dwp.gov.uk/browse/IN-101","description":"<p>GraphQL is a data query language and runtime designed and used at Facebook to request and deliver data to mobile and web apps since 2012. It has the potential to reduce the number of read services required due to the flexibility of the services it enables.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>DECLARATIVE</b> Query responses are decided by the client rather than the server. A GraphQL query returns exactly what a client asks for and no more.</li>\n\t<li><b>COMPOSITIONAL</b> A GraphQL query itself is a hierarchical set of fields. The query is shaped just like the data it returns. It is a natural way for product engineers to describe data requirements.</li>\n\t<li><b>STRONG-TYPED</b> A GraphQL query can be ensured to be valid within a GraphQL type system at development time allowing the server to make guarantees about the response. This makes it easier to build high-quality client tools.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>We believe that GraphQL represents a novel way of structuring the client-server contract. Servers publish a type system specific to their application, and GraphQL provides a unified language to query data within the constraints of that type system. That language allows product developers to express data requirements in a form natural to them: a declarative and hierarchal one.</p>\n\n<p>This is a liberating platform for product developers. With GraphQL, no more contending with ad hoc endpoints or object retrieval with multiple roundtrips to access server data; instead an elegant, hierarchical, declarative query dispatched to a single endpoint. No more frequent jumps between client and server development environments to do experimentation, or to change or create views of existing data; instead experiments are done and new views are built within a native, client development environment exclusively. No more shuffling unstructured data from ad hoc endpoints into business objects; instead, you have a powerful, introspective type system that serves as a platform for tool building.</p>\n\n<p>Product developers are free to focus on their client software and requirements while rarely leaving their development environment. They can more confidently support shipped clients as a system evolves; and they are using a protocol designed to operate well within the constraints of mobile applications. Product developers can query for exactly what they want, in the way they think about it, across their entire application's data model.</p>","user":"matt.smith","tags":["Experiment","GraphQL","MicroServices","Operational Efficiency","Prototyping",null],"created":{"$$date":1463992030000},"updated":{"$$date":1464085440000},"votes":"0","followers":"1","_id":"wxO5VQB84IIVT8RP"}
